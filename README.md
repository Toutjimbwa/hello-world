# hello-world
first github repository

I'm currently studying app-development mainly for android. I want to get an internship for 2016 november and december at an interesting company. I want to be in a company with at least 50 employees to get to know how a bigger organisation can work. In the future, I want to help develop nice interaction design and I have many ideas of how to use neural nets and other A.I technology to improve a lot of things. A lot.
